## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size




### My process

 I started by reviewing the design specification.  I then started markup knowing that the mobile and desktop layouts would use the same cards, with different page layouts.  From there, I stated the styling with mobile-first workflow and then created two media queries to handle the transition from the mobile to the desktop layouts.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project was a good excercise in CSS grid and I learned how CSS grid made the layout of the individual card and the page significantly easier than traditional CSS. I learned how to use minmax, auto, and 1fr to make the page flow from mobile-first to the desktop.
